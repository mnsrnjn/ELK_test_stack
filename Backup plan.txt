As the services are running on container so data is volatile what ever stored in the container.But the data which is stored in the mapped volume is persistent.
we should take the backup of the filesystem/volumes from the host machine where the containers are storing data.
Also any manual changes done to the docker cnfiguration will also loose in the next restart so these kind of action should be avoided.
The backup of the repository is very crusial as it stores the images and images is the source of a container.
Addition to this we must backup out secres like certificates,keystores securely.

All the backup taken must be encrypted and it should be automated.
